# Contributing to the repo

If you've decided to use my dotfiles, and found a bug or are missing something you think everyone would benefit from, feel free to contribute by opening an issue or creating a PR.

The process is straight-forward.

- Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by Kubernetes (but skip step 0 and 1)
- Fork the repo [git repository](https://github.com/romek-codes/nexusystem).
- Write your changes (new theme, bug fixes, issues fix, ...).
- Create a Pull Request against the main branch of nexusystem.
